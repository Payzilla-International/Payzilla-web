      <div>Introduction</div>
      <p>
        Payzilla Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer Policy
        (hereinafter – the “AML/KYC Policy”) is designated to prevent and
        mitigate possible risks of Payzilla being involved in any kind of
        illegal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both international and local regulations require Payzilla to implement
        effective internal procedures and mechanisms to prevent money
        laundering, terrorist financing, drug and human trafficking,
        proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, corruption and bribery and
        to take action in case of any form of suspicious activity from its
        Users.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Law Enforcement requests please direct your official document to our
        compliance team here.
      </p>
      <p>AML/KYC Policy covers the following matters:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Verification procedures</li>
        <li>Compliance Officer</li>
        <li>Monitoring transactions</li>
        <li>Risk assessment</li>
      </ol>
      <div>1. Verification procedures</div>
      <p>
        One of the international standards for preventing illegal activity is
        customer due diligence (“CDD”). According to CDD, Payzilla establishes
        its own verification procedures within the standards of anti-money
        laundering and “Know Your Customer” frameworks, including enhanced due
        diligence for customers presenting a higher risk, such as Politically
        Exposed Persons (PEPs).
      </p>
      <p>
        Payzilla’s identity verification procedure requires the User to provide
        Payzilla with reliable, independent source documents, data or
        information (e.g., national ID, international passport, bank statement,
        utility bill). For such purposes Payzilla reserves the right to collect
        User’s identification information for the AML/KYC Policy purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payzilla will take steps to confirm the authenticity of documents and
        information provided by the Users. All legal methods for double-checking
        identification information will be used and Payzilla reserves the right
        to investigate certain Users who have been determined to be risky or
        suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payzilla reserves the right to verify User’s identity in an on-going
        basis, especially when their identification information has been changed
        or their activity seemed to be suspicious (unusual for the particular
        User). In addition, Payzilla reserves the right to request up-to-date
        documents from the Users, even though they have passed identity
        verification in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        User’s identification information will be collected, stored, shared and
        protected strictly in accordance with the Payzilla’s Privacy Policy and
        related regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the User’s identity has been verified, Payzilla is able to remove
        itself from potential legal liability in a situation where its Services
        are used to conduct illegal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payzilla is prohibited from transacting with individuals, companies and
        countries that are on prescribed sanctions lists. Payzilla will
        therefore screen against United Nations, European Union, UK Treasury and
        US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions lists in all
        jurisdictions in which we operate.
      </p>
      <div>2. Compliance Officer</div>
      <p>
        The Compliance Officer is the person, duly authorized by Payzilla, whose
        duty is to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of the
        AML/KYC Policy. It is the Compliance Officer’s responsibility to
        supervise all aspects of Payzilla’s anti-money laundering and
        counter-terrorist financing, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting Users’ identification information;</li>
        <li>
          Establishing and updating internal policies and procedures for the
          completion, review, submission and retention of all reports and
          records required under the applicable laws and regulations;
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitoring transactions and investigating any significant deviations
          from normal activity;
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementing a records management system for appropriate storage and
          retrieval of documents, files, forms and logs;
        </li>
        <li>Updating risk assessment regularly;</li>
        <li>
          Providing law enforcement with information as required under the
          applicable laws and regulations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Compliance Officer is entitled to interact with law enforcement,
        which are involved in prevention of money laundering, terrorist
        financing and other illegal activity.
      </p>
      <div>3. Monitoring transactions</div>
      <p>
        The Users are known not only by verifying their identity (who they are)
        but, more importantly, by analyzing their transactional patterns (what
        they do). Therefore, Payzilla relies on data analysis as a
        risk-assessment and suspicion detection tool. Payzilla performs a
        variety of compliance-related tasks, including capturing data,
        filtering, record-keeping, investigation management, and reporting.
        System functionalities include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Daily check of Users against recognized “black lists” (e.g. OFAC),
          aggregating transfers by multiple data points, placing Users on watch
          and service denial lists, opening cases for investigation where
          needed, sending internal communications and filling out statutory
          reports, if applicable;
        </li>
        <li>Case and document management.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With regard to the AML/KYC Policy, Payzilla will monitor all
        transactions and it reserves the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensure that transactions of suspicious nature are reported to the
          proper law enforcement through the Compliance Officer;
        </li>
        <li>
          Request the User to provide any additional information and documents
          in case of suspicious transactions;
        </li>
        <li>
          suspend or terminate User’s Account when Payzilla has reasonably
          suspicion that such User engaged in illegal activity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The above list is not exhaustive and the Compliance Officer will monitor
        Users’ transactions on a day-to-day basis in order to define whether
        such transactions are to be reported and treated as suspicious or are to
        be treated as bona fide.
      </p>
      <div>4. Risk assessment</div>
      <p>
        Payzilla, in line with the international requirements, has adopted a
        risk-based approach to combating money laundering and terrorist
        financing. By adopting a risk-based approach, Payzilla is able to ensure
        that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist
        financing are commensurate to the identified risks. This will allow
        resources to be allocated in the most efficient ways. The principle is
        that resources should be directed in accordance with priorities so that
        the greatest risks receive the highest attention.
